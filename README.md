# Watch With Me

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This personal project was built as a Netflix clone

In this project I am making multiple api calls to two different DBs

The movie information come from omdbapi.com

All the videos were sourced from Google's YouTube V3 api

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you must create a .env file and ask me for the api keys: \
otherwise the project will replaces all the movie posters with filler images and text. 

### `npm init`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
